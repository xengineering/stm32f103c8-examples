# STM32F103C8 Examples

Example C code for the STM32F103C8 microcontrollers implemented with libopencm3. This repository is based on the [template project](https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3-template) for libopencm3.


## Recommended Toolchain

The toolchain described in this section is recommended to try out the software of this repository.

### The Target: STM32 Blue Pill Board

The STM32 Blue Pill board is based on the STM32F103C8 microcontroller. Because of the very low price it is an ideal board to try out the software of this repository.

### The Debugger/Programmer: Black Magic Probe

To program the target microcontroller you have to use a suitable programmer. A good choice could be the [Black Magic Probe](https://1bitsquared.com/products/black-magic-probe) (BMP). It has a built-in GDB server and serial debugger.
